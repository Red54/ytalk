~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This version of ytalk has been modified (patched) by orabidoo
<roger.espel.llima@pobox.com>, to fix a few bugs and add a few options.

Use at your own risk.

One bug fix makes the ytalk shell wrap its lines properly, instead of
making a column to the right of your screen. This is local, so if you
are patched and whoever you're talking to isn't, you will always see it
right and they will see it wrong.

The other bug fix makes ytalk process the "set scrolling-zone" escape
sequence (ESC[r) properly, which lets programs such as IRC work
within a ytalk shell.

Also, I've added an option in the makefile to use Solaris's ptys, since
they seem to handle them differently from everyone else.

The new options are -Y, to require CAPS on all y/n answers (so you don't 
answer without wanting to, when it asks you to add someone..), and -i, 
which won't attempt to catch new incoming talk requests with a "talk to
blah@blah?", but will just let the daemon beep you. In my opinion, you
always want -Y, and you want -i only if you have a separate window or
screen or console for talk requests.

You can specify these by adding the lines "turn caps on",
"turn noinvite on", respectively, to your ~/.ytalkrc.

Added the option "kill all unconnected" to the main menu, which makes
ytalk forget about any pending connections (i.e. people we are ringing
but haven't answered yet). This is useful when you are trying to get a
bunch of people on a ytalk and have them there finally, but then you
find that you're still trying to rering some of them.

Made it so that when ytalk is about to exit, it doesn't clear the window
for the last user who is disconnecting, so you still get to see the last
few lines the person typed if they ^C when you're not watching that
screen.

Some of these patches have been mailed to the ytalk maintainers, so they 
*might* make it into some future release.


30 Oct 96: 

Yet another patch... now you can define EIGHT_BIT_CLEAN in the Makefile,
and if your curses is 8-bit-clean you'll have all those wonderful
accented characters (as long as the other end has them too, of course).

Also, ^H and Delete (ASCII 8 and 127 respectively) are *always*
understood as delete characters now, in addition to whatever is set by
your stty (it's not clean, but it works better this way in practice).


11 Nov 96 :

Removed the whole TCP NODELAY mode, since all that does is disable the
Nagle algorithm, which at most delays packets by .2 sec (right?).



The original README follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

YTalk Make Procedure:

    To restore the Makefile to its original state, run:

	make start

    If wish to support the X11 interface, edit the configuration at
    the top of the 'Imakefile' file then run:

	xmkmf 
	make
    
    If you do not have "xmkmf" on your system, then you cannot support
    X11 through ytalk at this time.  Ask your system administrator to
    install "xmkmf" (it stands for "X Make Makefile").

    If you do not have X11 installed on your system, or you do not
    wish to support the X11 interface, then edit the configuration at
    the top of the 'Makefile' file then run:

	make

The resulting executable program will be named "ytalk".

If you ever go back and change some configuration parameters at the
top of Imakefile or Makefile, you should run 'make clean' before running
'xmkmf' and/or 'make' again.  This will ensure that everything recompiles.

A manpage will automatically be built.  It will be named "ytalk.cat".
You can read the manual page by running:

	more ytalk.cat

If you make changes to this source code or if you have any ideas for
neat new features, _PLEASE_ mail me and let me know about it.  Chances
are I'll incorporate your ideas/changes into the next version and put a
great big "thank you" note to you in the documentation and source
code.  If you do change something or add features, and you intend to
give a copy to a friend, please make sure _your_ name appears somewhere
in the documentation so that _I_ don't get reams of mail or bug reports
about features I didn't know existed... :-)

If you have questions or suggestions, I'd be happy to hear from you
